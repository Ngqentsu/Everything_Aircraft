This project is one of the absolute passions of mine. As an Aeronautical Engineering student,
I like to talk and discuss aircraft a lot so I figured that an aircraft questionnaire or quiz is \
absolutely fitting for a dynamic front end project. The website will have a questionnaire or \
quiz (multiple choice, fill in and/or True or False).
